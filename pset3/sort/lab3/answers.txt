sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?:
The difference in running time between reversed list and sorted list is the biggest of all three "sorts".
That is consistent with the fact that bubble sort has big O of nˆ2 and omega of n.
Besides, reversed list is the worst case scenario for bubble sort, and sorted list is the best case scenario.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?:
There is little change in running time between reversed list and sorted list,
and that time is way smaller than that of sort3.
That is consistent with the fact that merge sort has big O of n*log(n) and omega of n*log(n).

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?:
There is little change in running time between reversed list and sorted list,
and that time is way smallerbigger than that of sort2.
That is consistent with the fact that selection sort has big O of nˆ2 and omega of nˆ2.
